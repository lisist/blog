- We continue to advise caution. The sour spot may claim more capital market victims before equities can make sustaned advances. Economic growth surprises will be to the downside.

- Junk bonds, cryptos, momentum plays and Big Tech are well off their highs, but remain vulnerable.

- Watch market action in equities that already have been hammered, such as smallcap growth and emerging markets, for signs that risk assets are becoming insulated against Fed hawkishness.

- Oil futures and energy stocks remain attractive on a 12-18 month horizon, but the rallies have overshot on the back of geopolitical fears and are due for a correction.

The Fed has not even begun to bite, but officials are barking loud and clear. The central bank believes it is ar behind the curve and that will not change until inflation has peaked and/or financial markets riot. We do not advise bottom fishing. Rather, our focus is on identifying potential victims and watching for signs that risk assets are becoming insulated from moentary restraint.

We have been too bullish on government bonds, but did expect a flatter yield curve. This is panning out even though quantitative tightening would incrase the supply of government bonds to the private sector. Overweight bonds versus equities and stick with large cap, quality and defensive equity tilts. The reward for taking risk remains poor until the Fed backs away from the brink. For now, this is not a time to front run the central banks.

# Sour spot Victims

Last month, our Editor-in-Chief Tony Boeckh made the case that the "sweet spot" inplace for much of the previous two years had turned sour because of valuation and policy headwinds. The sour spot remains intact as the Fed panics in the face of an inflation scare, which in turn increases the odds of downside economic grwoth surprises.

Ominously, the 10-year/2-year yield spread has significantly flattened and the one-year forward version of this curve already has inverted.

The main driver has been a divergence in short-term versus long-term expeted inflation prospects. In contrast, real yields have had a parallel upward shift along the curve. The threat to markets is that the Fed is responding to the short-term inflation scare, even though longer-term inflation expectations remain tame. That will limit corporate pricing power and profit growth vis-a-vis rosy consensus estimates. For example, the Bloomberg 2022 consensus forecast for S&P 500 EPS growth is 17%.

More specifically, macro drivers leave the door open to more carnage and volatility ahead:

- a peak in actual inflation is not imminent given the rise in oil prices, wage growth and rents. The Fed generally argets inflation 12-24 months ahead, but current inflation is unusually important because they believe they are so far behind the curve.

- Consumers may pull back as post-pandemic headwinds accumulate. January retail sales were robust, but there are cracks under the surface. The plunge in consumer sentiment is consistent with fiscal stimulus giving the way to fiscal drag, the surge in household wealth topping out and inflation that has caused "sticker shock" in the price of many consumer durables.

- The rising growth tax resulting from higher oil prices, dollar appreciation and rising interest rates points to a difficult economic environment.

The sour spot already has led to a stealth bear market under the surface. We are focusing on four candidates that remain vulnerable in a climate of rising interest rates and weaker growth: high-yield corporate bonds, cryptocurrencies, momentum-driven equities and Big Tech.
